# Mood to Emoji ðŸ˜Š

This is a Python project that turns mood words into emojis!

## How it works
Run the script in your terminal. When it asks how you feel, type a mood like "happy" or "tired," and it will show you an emoji that matches it

## How to run it

Click the green **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**,
unzip the folder,
open a terminal and navigate to the unzipped folder,
run the script

## Example
```
How are you feeling today?
Type a word that describes your mood: happy
Hereâ€™s mood emoji match: ðŸ˜Š
```
```
How are you feeling today?
Type a word that describes your mood: blah
I don't know that mood yet, but ask my developer, Sagan, to add it. 
```
