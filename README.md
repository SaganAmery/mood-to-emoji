# Mood to Emoji 😊

This is a beginner Python project that turns mood words into emojis!

## How it works
Run the script in your terminal. When it asks how you feel, type a mood like "happy" or "tired," and it will show you an emoji that matches.

## Example
```
How are you feeling today?
Type a word that describes your mood: happy
Here’s mood emoji match: 😊
```
```
How are you feeling today?
Type a word that describes your mood: blah
I don't know that mood yet, but ask my developer, Sagan, to add it. 
```
